## ‚ö° Performance & Caching

Release Viewer uses intelligent edge caching to provide fast response times while respecting GitHub API rate limits:

- **Browser Cache**: 10 minutes - keeps recently viewed releases available for quick re-access
- **Edge Cache**: 4 hours - reduces server load and GitHub API calls for popular repositories
- **Cache Strategy**: Automatic cache invalidation ensures fresh data while maximizing performance

This caching approach significantly improves user experience, especially when browsing popular repositories or revisiting recently viewed releases.
